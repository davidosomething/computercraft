## Installation

From a new ComputerCraft computer run:

```lua
pastebin get tpB2kgib dko
dko bootstrap
dko update
```

Then restart to have CraftOS autorun the startup script.

After startup runs once and gets files via pastebin, future requests will be
made directly to GitHub via the HTTP API if you have that enabled.
