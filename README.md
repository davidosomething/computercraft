# davidosomething's computercraft scripts

Lua scripts for [ComputerCraft](http://www.computercraft.info/) v1.7+.
Most of these are mirrored on
[my pastebin account](http://pastebin.com/u/davidosomething)
so you can grab them individually there.

## Installation

From a new ComputerCraft computer run

```
pastebin get uVtX8Yx6 startup
label set COMPUTER_LABEL
```

where `COMPUTER_LABEL` is one of `reactor` or `remote`. Then restart to have
CraftOS autorun the startup script.

## Docs

See [ldoc generated docs](http://davidosomething.github.io/computercraft/) for
more details.
